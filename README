Intro:
This program only works with the following devices:

ELUSB-1 
ELUSB-2

support will be extended to other lascar products if possible (if I actually have another products in my hands)

------------
Install, ubuntu > 9.04 (not tested under 9.04):

We need read and write access to the device, in order to do this as simple user and not root, you need to create a udev rule.
- sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules
- copy this into the created file: BUS=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTR{idProduct}=="0002", MODE:="0666"
- reboot

Pyusb is needed to talk to the device, download it here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/files/
- unzip the file (I used the latest version pyusb-1.0.0-a0.zip)
- compile the lib, into the extracted directory type: "python setup.py install"
- copy the compiled files: cp -arv usb/ /usr/lib/pyshared/
- test the pyusb libs: open a console, type "python" then "import usb.core" the module should load silently, if an error occurs then something has failed, retry the previous steps. Exit with CTRL+D

------------
Run the program:
execute the eltuxusb.py file: ./eltuxusb.py or: python eltuxusb.py
